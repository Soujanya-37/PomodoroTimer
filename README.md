#PomodoroTimer

This is a simple, feature-rich Pomodoro timer that runs directly in your command line or terminal. It's built with standard Python and requires no external libraries.

It's a perfect tool to help you stay focused on your work or studies by breaking your time into focused sessions and breaks.
